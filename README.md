## Yu-Gi-Oh Tournament Manager

### Description
The **Yu-Gi-Oh Tournament Manager** is a simple Java-based desktop application designed to help organize and manage Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments. Built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI), this application allows tournament organizers to easily register players, manage match pairings, track results, and automatically calculate standings across multiple rounds.

This application includes support for Swiss-style pairings with a BYE system for odd-numbered participants, keeping track of wins, losses, and draws for each player throughout the tournament. Final standings are displayed at the end, showing each player's total points and match history.

### Features
- **Player Registration**: Input the number of players and their names.
- **Tournament Setup**: Define the tournament name and the number of rounds.
- **Swiss Pairing System**: Automatically pair players for each round based on their current standings.
- **BYE System**: Assign a BYE (free win) to a player when thereâ€™s an odd number of participants.
- **Match Result Tracking**: Input the result of each match (win, loss, or draw) for automatic score calculation.
- **Final Standings**: View the final player standings based on their win-loss-draw record and total points.
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly interface for managing all tournament interactions.
- **Dynamic Player Stats**: View player stats such as total wins, losses, draws, and points after each round.
